# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 07, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Completed 'The Cascade' section on The Odin Project

**Thoughts:** I learned about the cascade in CSS and how it prioritizes things, and finally began styling the recipes HTML files I did in a previous exercise. I'm still quite rusty, but I am getting the hang of it again. I am also getting more comfortable with navigating and using the command line in Terminal, which is cool.

### Day 2: February 08, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Learned about the alternative box model. Styled recipes home page.

**Thoughts**: I learned a few new tools about how to use devtools and make changes in the side bar, and about box-border vs content-border and the differences on how those are calculated/laid out. I styled my recipes project home page to make the recipe links cards with a hover interaction. I'm feeling more confident about coding this time around, and my UX knowledge is starting to click with it.

### Day 3: February 09, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Learned about normal flow concept. Made recipe site text more legible.

**Thoughts** I'm better understanding how these concepts work and able to differentiate what to use and when. For the recipe site, I decided to bring in some UX into in and be mindful of the page content width as well as the max characters per line when reading. I need to see about making sure the colors I chose are accessible and have the right contrast next time.

### Day 4: February 10, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Learned flex shorthand, growing/shrinking, axes and alignment.

**Thoughts** Learning about flex box today was kind of a lot and I am sure I will need to review it multiple times before I get it. But I did try to implement some of what I learned into the recipes site project to try to make the home page more responsive. It is starting to come together, but I need to tweak it a little more. Tomorrow I will need to complete the Alignment page assignments/reading before moving on to the next lesson.
