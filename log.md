# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 07, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Completed 'The Cascade' section on The Odin Project

**Thoughts:** I learned about the cascade in CSS and how it prioritizes things, and finally began styling the recipes HTML files I did in a previous exercise. I'm still quite rusty, but I am getting the hang of it again. I am also getting more comfortable with navigating and using the command line in Terminal, which is cool.

### Day 2: February 08, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Learned about the alternative box model. Styled recipes home page.

**Thoughts**: I learned a few new tools about how to use devtools and make changes in the side bar, and about box-border vs content-border and the differences on how those are calculated/laid out. I styled my recipes project home page to make the recipe links cards with a hover interaction. I'm feeling more confident about coding this time around, and my UX knowledge is starting to click with it.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
