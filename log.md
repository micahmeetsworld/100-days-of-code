# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 07, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Completed 'The Cascade' section on The Odin Project

**Thoughts:** I learned about the cascade in CSS and how it prioritizes things, and finally began styling the recipes HTML files I did in a previous exercise. I'm still quite rusty, but I am getting the hang of it again. I am also getting more comfortable with navigating and using the command line in Terminal, which is cool.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
